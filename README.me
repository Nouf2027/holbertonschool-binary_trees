This project is about implementing the concept of a Binary Tree using the C programming language.  
A Binary Tree is made up of nodes, and each node can connect to two other nodes — one on the left and one on the right.  
The first node in the tree is called the “root”, and all other nodes grow from it like branches.  
Each node holds some data and pointers that connect it to the other nodes.  
Through this project, we can understand how to create a tree, add nodes, delete nodes, and move between them in different ways.
